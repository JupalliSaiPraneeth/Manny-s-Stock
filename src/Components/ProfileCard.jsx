inspired, some my own.

Each page holds fragments of emotions I never spoke aloud, stitched into words instead.

Here, silence turns into whispers, and whispers grow into stories.

Some are soft like dawn, some heavy as midnight, yet all are meant to be felt. If you read them, you're not just entering my words-you're stepping into the spaces of me I could never say out loud.</p>
